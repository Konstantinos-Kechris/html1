			<h1><span>Quotes</span></h1>
				<p id="Γνωμικα"> 
					Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work. <br/>
					Dignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them. <br/>
					Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.<br/>
					He who will not economize will have to agonize.<br/>
					It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.<br/>
					Choose a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life.<br/>
					Ability will never catch up with the demand for it.<br/>
					It isn't positions which lend distinction, but men who enhance positions.<br/>
					Knowledge, if it does not determine action, is dead to us.<br/>
					After I'm dead, I'd rather have people ask why I have no monument than why I have one.<br/>
					Great deeds are usually wrought at great risks.<br/>
					Haste in every business brings failures.<br/>
					Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises. <br/>
					In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.<br/>
					Beware the barrenness of a busy life.<br/>
					The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.<br/>
					Know how to listen and you will profit even from those who talk badly.<br/>
					Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.<br/>
					Make the best use of what's in your power and take the rest as it happens.<br/>
